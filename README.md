# Hate-Speech-Detection

The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting racist and xenophobic sentences. Initially, we create a small dataset containing 100 sentences for each class (racism and xenophobia), train a DistilBERT model on this dataset, and then optimize the trained model. The project involves the following steps: dataset creation, model training, model optimization, and prediction.
